# Sales-Dashboard

In this project I created a responsive Sales dashboard which shows sales figures for a whole year and automatically updates itself whenever new sales record is added to the database (folder located in a local desktop in this case) as I incorporated an automated calendar dimension table to the data model.

This dashboard automatically updates total sales per city over a period of time and also visualizes the profit margin as each month goes by. 

This report makes it possible for stakeholders to see which category/sub-category of products are in more demand than others whcih can help with decision making on which products to make available all month/year long.
